Why Go?
    1. Power of C & C++ without the complexities of C & C++
        Auto Memory Management (GC)
        Support for pointers (No pointer arthmetic)
    2. No VM 
    3. Simplicity
        25 keywords
        - No access modifiers (public, private, protected)
        - No classes (Only structs)
        - No inheritance (Only composition)
        - No exceptions (Only errors)
        - No reference types (Only value types)
        - No pointer arithmetic
        - No implicit type conversion
    4. Extremely light weight
        compiles to native code
        No need for any app servers
        Performance is equivalent to C++
    5. Built for concurrency
        concurrency = the ability to have more than one execution path
        OS Threads are costly
            1 OS thread = 2 MB of memory
        1000s of goroutines can be created using the same memory needed for 1 OR 2 OS thread(s)
        A concurrent operation in golang = a goroutine
        Concurrency is built in the language
            - go, chan (data type), <- (channel operator), range, select etc
        SDK
            sync package


To run a go program
    go run <filename.go>

To create a build   
    go build <filename.go>
    go build -o <build_filename> <filename.go>

To create a build for other platforms
for ex: windows
    
    GOOS=windows GOARCH=386 go build <filename.go>
    GOOS=windows GOARCH=386 go build -o <build_filename> <filename.go>

    The list of other platform configurations can be found at :
        https://go.dev/doc/install/source#environment

    To change the default environment variables
        go env -w GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64
        go build -o <build_filename> <filename.go>
